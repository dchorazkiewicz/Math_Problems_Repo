## Lines

### Ex 1. 

Write the equation of the line passing through points $P(1,2)$ and $Q(3,-1)$ in slope-intercept form and general form.

### Ex 2. 

Find the parametric equation of the line perpendicular to the line from Ex 1 and passing through point $R(0,1)$.

### Ex 3. 

A line passes through point $A(1, 2)$ and is parallel to the line $y = 2x + 3$. Find the equation of this line.

### Ex 4. 

For lines in general form $l_1: 2x-3y+1=0$ and $l_2: 4x-6y-5=0$, determine whether they are parallel, perpendicular, or intersect at a single point. If they have a common point, calculate its coordinates.

### Ex 5. 

Calculate the angle between the line $y = x + 3$ and the $Ox$ axis.
  
### Ex 6. 

Provide a vector perpendicular to the line $x + y + 1 = 0$.

### Ex 7. 

$\star$ Find the distance of point $S(2,3)$ from the line $l: 3x-4y+5=0$.
   
### Ex 8. 

$\star$ Write the equation of the line passing through point $T(1,1)$ and forming an angle of $\pi/6$ with the OX axis. Also, provide the intersection point with the OY axis.
