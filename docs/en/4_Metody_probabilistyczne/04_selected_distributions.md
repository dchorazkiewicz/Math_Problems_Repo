# TASK LIST NO. 4: Selected Random Variable Distributions

## Task 1
The probability of failure of experimental equipment in a single experiment is $p=0.02$. Experiments can be performed any number of times. Calculate the probability that the second failure:

a) occurs at the tenth experiment,
b) does not occur in the first ten experiments.

## Task 2
The probability that a product subjected to a test fails the test is $p=0.01$. Calculate the probability that among 200 such products (independently tested), at most 2 will fail the test.

*Hint: Since $n=200$ is large and $p=0.01$ is small, use the Poisson approximation with parameter $\lambda = np$.*

## Task 3
The time (in minutes) between consecutive subscriber calls at a certain telephone exchange is a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=2$. Calculate the average time between consecutive calls and the probability that a call occurs before 3 minutes elapse.

## Task 4
The failure-free operation time $X$ of a certain device has an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=5$. Calculate:

a) the average failure-free operation time of the device,
b) the median,
c) the probability that the failure-free operation time of the device is at least 5 hours.

## Task 5
The interval between consecutive graduations of a stopwatch scale is $0.1$ s. Time on this stopwatch is read with an accuracy of a whole graduation. Assuming a uniform distribution of the time reading error, calculate the probability that the time was measured with an error exceeding $0.02$ s.

*Hint: The density of the uniform distribution is constant in the interval $(-0.05; 0.05)$.*

## Task 6
An automated machine produces 10-gram weights. The mass measurement errors of these weights have a normal distribution with an expected value $\mu=0$ g and a standard deviation $\sigma=0.01$ g. Find the probability that the mass measurement will be performed with an error not exceeding $0.02$ g.

## Task 7
Let the random variable $X$ have a distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$. Calculate the probability $P(|X-\mu| < k\sigma)$ for:

a) $k=1.96$ (confidence level 0.95),
b) $k=2.58$ (confidence level 0.99).

## Task 8
A certain measuring instrument makes a systematic error of $1$ m in the direction of overestimating the measurement and a random error with a distribution $N(0; 0.5)$.

a) Calculate the average value of the measurement error.
b) Determine the probability that the error with which the examined objects are measured does not exceed $2$ m.

## Task 9
The strength of steel ropes from mass production is a random variable with a distribution $N(1000 \text{ kg/cm}^2, 50 \text{ kg/cm}^2)$. Calculate what percentage of ropes has a strength less than $900 \text{ kg/cm}^2$.

## Task 10
Determine and sketch the cumulative distribution function of the Rayleigh distribution, whose density is given by the formula:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{2}{\lambda} x \exp(-\frac{x^2}{\lambda}) & \text{for } x > 0 \\ 0 & \text{for } x \leqslant 0 \end{cases}
$$

Then calculate the median of this distribution.

*Hint: This distribution is often used in telecommunications to model signal fading.*
