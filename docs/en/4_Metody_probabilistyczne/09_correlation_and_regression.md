# TASK LIST NO. 9: Correlation and Regression Analysis

## Task 1
The dependence between two features $X$ and $Y$ was investigated based on a 10-element sample (e.g., $X$ – file size in MB, $Y$ – transmission time in sec). Measurement results:

| $i$ | $x_i$ | $y_i$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 3.5 | 1.6 |
| 2 | 3.4 | 2.9 |
| 3 | 2.1 | 1.5 |
| 4 | 5.4 | 3.5 |
| 5 | 1.1 | 0.6 |
| 6 | 5.1 | 2.5 |
| 7 | 6.9 | 7.1 |
| 8 | 4.0 | 3.5 |
| 9 | 4.5 | 2.1 |
| 10 | 2.5 | 2.6 |

Calculate the Pearson linear correlation coefficient $r$. Is the dependence strong?

*Hint: Create a helper table with columns $x_i^2, y_i^2, x_i y_i$ and calculate the sums.*

## Task 2
In a certain network experiment, data regarding the number of errors ($X$) and system response time ($Y$) were collected. Since there was a lot of data, ready-made sums were calculated for $n=25$ measurements:

$$
\sum x_i = 375, \quad \sum y_i = 175
$$

$$
\sum x_i^2 = 6125, \quad \sum y_i^2 = 1245, \quad \sum x_i y_i = 2615
$$

Calculate the correlation coefficient $r$ and the means $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$.

## Task 3
For a population in which the studied features $(X, Y)$ have a two-dimensional normal distribution, a sample of 10 elements was taken. The measurement results are listed in the table:

| Measurement No. ($i$) | $x_i$ | $y_i$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 38.5 | 39.5 |
| 2 | 41.1 | 42.1 |
| 3 | 37.8 | 38.0 |
| 4 | 36.0 | 36.4 |
| 5 | 32.2 | 34.0 |
| 6 | 36.8 | 34.5 |
| 7 | 33.5 | 32.5 |
| 8 | 35.3 | 36.4 |
| 9 | 31.1 | 37.5 |
| 10 | 42.5 | 41.5 |

a) Construct a **scatter plot** (correlation diagram).
b) Determine the equation of the linear regression line of $Y$ on $X$ ($y = ax + b$) using the **method of least squares**.
*(Data based on Table 4.1, Krysicki Part II, p. 149)*.

## Task 4
Using the regression line equation determined in Task 3, estimate the predicted value of feature $Y$ (e.g., clock speed) if feature $X$ (temperature) takes the value $x=10$.

What risk does forecasting for $x$ outside the data range of the sample (extrapolation) carry?

## Task 5
For the data from Task 2, where the correlation coefficient was $r \approx -0.1$ (to be verified in calculations), verify at the significance level $\alpha=0.05$ the hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$ (no correlation in the population) against the hypothesis $H_1: \rho \neq 0$.

*Hint: Use the $t$-Student statistic:*

$$
t = \frac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\sqrt{n-2}
$$

## Task 6
For the regression line determined in Task 3, calculate the residual variance $s_r^2$ (or the standard deviation of residuals $s_r$).
Interpretation: How much are the actual measurement points "scattered" around the determined regression line?

*Formula: $s_r^2 = s_y^2 (1 - r^2)$.*

## Task 7
Two experts evaluated the quality of the interface of 10 applications, ranking them from 1 to 10.

* Expert A: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$
* Expert B: $2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9$

Calculate Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Do the experts agree in their evaluations?

*Hint: Use the rank correlation formula based on the differences $d_i$ between ranks.*

## Task 8
Two regression lines were determined: $y$ with respect to $x$ and $x$ with respect to $y$.

$$
y = -0.6x + 2
$$

$$
x = -1.2y + 1
$$

Calculate the correlation coefficient $r$ based on the slope coefficients of these lines.

*Hint: The relationship $r^2 = a_{yx} \cdot a_{xy}$ holds. Remember the sign of the correlation coefficient!*

## Task 9
Suppose the dependence between algorithm execution time ($Y$) and data size ($X$) is exponential: $y = a \cdot e^{bx}$. How can these data be transformed so that known formulas for linear regression can be applied and parameters $a$ and $b$ determined?

*Hint: Take the logarithm of both sides of the equation ($\ln y = \ln a + bx$). Then the new dependent variable is $Z = \ln Y$.*

## Task 10
Three parameters are monitored in a system: $X_1$ (CPU), $X_2$ (RAM), $X_3$ (Disk IO). Pairwise correlations were calculated:
$r_{12} = 0.8$, $r_{13} = 0.1$, $r_{23} = 0.2$.

Which variables are strongly correlated with each other, and which are almost independent? What does this mean for the system administrator (e.g., will upgrading RAM affect CPU usage)?
