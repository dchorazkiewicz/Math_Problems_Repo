# TASK LIST NO. 7: Point and Interval Estimation

## Task 1
[cite_start]Find the confidence interval for the unknown mean value $\mu$ of a population, in the case where $\sigma$ is known, based on an $n$-element simple sample $X_1, ..., X_n$[cite: 231].

[cite_start]Data: From a population with a standard deviation $\sigma=0.14$, a sample of $n=100$ elements was taken (e.g., voltage measurements on a processor)[cite: 232]. The sample mean was $\bar{x}=2.5$. [cite_start]Determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean (assume $1-\alpha = 0.95$, which gives $u_{\alpha} = 1.96$)[cite: 233].

## Task 2
[cite_start]The durability of 10 randomly selected structural elements was measured (or e.g., battery life of 10 laptops)[cite: 235]. [cite_start]The following results were obtained: $383, 284, 339, 340, 305, 386, 378, 335, 344, 346$[cite: 236].

[cite_start]Assuming that the distribution of the feature is normal, determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean durability[cite: 236].

[cite_start]*Hint: Since $n=10$ is small ($n<30$) and we do not know $\sigma$, calculate $s$ from the sample and use the Student's t-distribution*[cite: 237].

## Task 3
[cite_start]To determine the electron charge, 26 measurements were made using the Millikan method[cite: 239]. [cite_start]A mean of $\bar{x} = 1.574 \cdot 10^{-19}$ and a standard deviation of $s = 0.043 \cdot 10^{-19}$ were obtained[cite: 240].

[cite_start]Determine the confidence interval for the mean charge at a confidence level of $0.99$[cite: 240].

## Task 4
[cite_start]A 300-element sample was taken from a population of cotton fibers and their lengths were measured[cite: 242]. [cite_start]The mean $\bar{x}=27.43$ mm and variance $s^2=51.598$ were calculated[cite: 243].

[cite_start]Find the 95% realization of the confidence interval for the unknown average fiber length[cite: 243].

[cite_start]*Hint: With such a large $n$ ($n=300$), the Student's t-distribution is practically identical to the normal distribution, so the statistic $u_{\alpha}$ can be used*[cite: 244].

## Task 5
[cite_start]Measurements of sea depth (or e.g., network latency) are made in a certain specific location[cite: 246].

[cite_start]How many independent measurements must be made to assume with a confidence level of $0.95$ that the absolute error of estimating the mean will not exceed $10$ m, if the error distribution is normal with a variance of $\sigma^2 = 180$ $m^2$? [cite: 247]

## Task 6
[cite_start]Among 120 randomly selected employees of a certain plant, 17 did not meet the work performance standard (in IT: 17 out of 120 servers did not meet SLA requirements)[cite: 249].

[cite_start]Determine the 95% realization of the confidence interval for the fraction $p$ of employees not meeting the standard in the entire plant[cite: 249].

## Task 7
[cite_start]15 measurements were made of the time to repair yarn breaks on looms[cite: 251]. The sample variance was calculated as $s^2 = 134.2$. [cite_start]Assuming that this time has a normal distribution, determine the 90% confidence interval for the variance $\sigma^2$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$[cite: 252].

[cite_start]*Hint: Use the chi-square ($\chi^2$) distribution tables*[cite: 253].

## Task 8
[cite_start]Two samples were drawn for a certain feature with a normal distribution[cite: 255]:

* Sample 1: $n=25$, mean $\bar{x}=15$, deviation $s=5$.
* Sample 2: $n=100$, mean $\bar{x}=15$, deviation $s=5$.

[cite_start]Calculate the lengths of the 95% confidence intervals for both samples[cite: 255]. [cite_start]How does a fourfold increase in sample size affect precision (interval width)? [cite: 256]

## Task 9
A simple sample of size $n=5$ is given: $\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$. [cite_start]Calculate the value of the unbiased estimator of the expected value ($\bar{x}$) and the unbiased estimator of the variance ($s^2$)[cite: 257].

[cite_start]Explain why we divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$ for variance[cite: 258].

## Task 10
The table presents the results of the percentage starch content in 80 potatoes (data grouped into a frequency distribution). [cite_start]The sample mean is $\bar{x}=17.525\%$, and the standard deviation is $s=1.84\%$[cite: 260].

[cite_start]Assuming a confidence level of 0.95, estimate the average starch content in the entire batch[cite: 260].
