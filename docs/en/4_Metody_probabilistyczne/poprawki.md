Please apply the following corrections to the English markdown files to supply missing data:

1. **File: en_10_advanced_methods.md (Task 8)**
   In the task description, after "Construct a sequential test...", add specific risk values by appending the phrase:
   "Assume Type I error risk $\alpha = 0.05$ and Type II error risk $\beta = 0.10$."

2. **File: en_11_decision_theory.md (Task 1)**
   The task is currently unsolvable numerically. Replace general terms with specific data:
   - Change "H_0: p = p_0" to "H_0: p = 0.02".
   - Change "H_1: p = p_1" to "H_1: p = 0.10".
   - Change the phrase "defective items in a randomly drawn sample exceeds a certain k" to "defective items in a sample of size $n=50$ exceeds $k=3$".

3. **File: en_05_limit_theorems.md (Task 10)**
   The phrasing is ambiguous. Change the task description to:
   "For the probability distribution of the random variable $K$ calculated in Task 7 (number of failure-free days), prepare a probability histogram."
